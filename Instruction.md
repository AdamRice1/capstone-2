BattleShip Instructions:

Welcome to Battleship. The game of guessing and out smarting your opponent. 

Battleship is a war-themed board game (or in this case, a game in the terminal) where you try to guess the opponents ship location and sink their ships.

A paper and pencil version of this game dates back to World War 1, but most people are more familiar with the plastic board game first created in 1967.

In this version of the game it is only single player, as you will be playing against a bad guessing algorithm.



Step 1: Enter Your Name when prompted, so we can record your score. 

Step 2: Place your boats in order of size. From largest too smallest.

        -The ships vary in size from 5 length to 2 length.
        -Input the X coordinate. Between 1 and 10. Press Enter.
        -Input the Y coordinate. Between 1 and 10. Press Enter.
        -Select a direction in which that ship should be placed. The selected coordinate will be the point from which it extends.
        -Do this until all 5 ships have been placed.
        
Step 3: Guess the location of the computer's ships by inputting coordinates.

        -Input the X coordinate. Between 1 and 10. Press Enter.
        -Input the Y coordinate. Between 1 and 10. Press Enter.
        -You will be show an explosion emoji if you guess a location correctly.
        -When you sink a ship the explosions will turn into a SOS emoji.
        -You can see where your ships are and where the computer has guessed.
        
Step 4: Do this until either you, or the computer have sunk every single one of the opponents ships.
        
        -Sink a ship by guessing every coordinate that a ship takes up with it's length.
        -When the game is over a leaderboard will print out showing how many turns the game lasted.
