UPER

1. 
    The problem is to create a terminal based basic I/O game.  I need to do this in java and use OOP to get it done.  
    I will also have to utilize OOP principles and use Interfaces, Abstract Classes, Lambdas, and Streams to receive full credit.

2.
    My plan is to create the game Battleship.  Battleship is the right level of complication with simple I/O to allow for a good game.
    I will need to create a few classes to make this work.  A game board, players, ships, a computer player/AI, and a move class.
    I would also like to add a leader board class even though I will be the only person playing the game.
    I will need to create several try/catch error handling solutions to prepare for invalid inputs when placing ships and guessing.

3.
    I did a fair amount of research into this and found I had a good plan.  I have created the classes and the basic functionality works.
    I am having trouble using my player Interfaces when the print out of the game intro happens.
    Also my plan was to create the basic game and then refactor one function into a Lambda.

4.
    I am realizing that my Lambda plan my have not been the best approach.  I am happy with the functionality of my game.
    Though I wish I would have included more pillers of OOP into the design.  I think if I would have had that as more of a priority I could have included them better.  I just realized the night before presentations that I probably should have had a ship abstract class and extended those to both the player and the computer ship classes. I believe that could have worked better.
